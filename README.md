Build an asset management system in Rust 

Here are the steps to build an asset management system in Rust:

Familiarize yourself with the Rust programming language and its syntax.

Choose a database to store asset information, such as PostgreSQL or SQLite, and learn how to interact with it using Rust.

Decide on a framework or library to build the application on, such as Rocket or Actix.

Define the data structure for assets and decide what information will be stored for each asset (e.g. name, value, date acquired, etc.).

Design the API for the asset management system, including endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting assets.

Write the code for the API and database interaction, handling errors and implementing security measures as needed.

Test the application thoroughly to ensure it is functioning as expected.

Deploy the asset management system to a hosting platform, such as Heroku or DigitalOcean, and monitor its performance to ensure it is running smoothly.

Note: This is a high-level overview of building an asset management system in Rust, and the details will vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.

Code.   
       use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Asset {
    name: String,
    value: f64,
}

fn main() {
    let mut assets = HashMap::new();

    assets.insert(
        String::from("asset1"),
        Asset {
            name: String::from("Asset 1"),
            value: 100.0,
        },
    );

    assets.insert(
        String::from("asset2"),
        Asset {
            name: String::from("Asset 2"),
            value: 200.0,
        },
    );

    println!("All assets: {:?}", assets);

    let asset = assets.get("asset1");
    if let Some(asset) = asset {
        println!("Asset: {:?}", asset);
    } else {
        println!("Asset not found");
    }
}
